  HOW TO USE THIS ADDON:

    First place the ashita version of renamer in your \Addons\ directory.
    Now place a list file in \Addons\renamer\lists\ or Edit an exiting list.

      /addon load renamer
    This will load the addon, but in an inactive state.

      /renamer load filename
    This loads the list of objects to rename from the specified file and activates the addon.
    To change to a different list simply input the command again using anotehr file name.

  TO AUTO LOAD:
    Place the above commands (both of them) in your default script for your ashita profile.

  OTHER COMMANDS:
      /renamer status
    Will display the currently loaded name list file, if any.

      /renamer stop
      /renamer unload
    Either of these will tell the addon to cease renaming objects.
